(under construction....)


To run the executable, one can start from the scripts I wrote:

demo_hiRes.bat
demo_loRes.bat

and possibly modify the script to fit his/her needs.

Also, once the image/annotation files have been processed by the viewer, they are saved as img.data/ano.data locally. 
To avoid repeatedly downloading the same piece of data, one can use:

VolumeViewer.exe  --img img.data  --ano ano.data  --dRes  <x-res>  <y-res> <z-res>

instead, to read those files directly.

As for UI instructions, below are stripped from the README of my previous release an half year ago:
(probably the most important one is SHIFT + RIGHT-MOUSE-BUTTON )


==================== KEYBOARD ==========================

UP  : moving the camera forward
DOWN: moving the camera backward

SHIFT+UP  : moving the viewing plane forward
SHIFT+DOWN: moving the viewing plane backward

R: resetting the viewing plane

Q,W: rotation around Y axis
A,Z: rotation around X axis
S,x: rotation around Z axis

3: setting the viewing plane to X-Y plane 
SHIFT+3: resetting the camera to look at X-Y plane from top
(Simiarly for 1 and 2)

O: toggle orthographics/perspective projection
Esc: exit the viewer


==================== MOUSE ===========================

Right  mouse button: drawing the zoom-in box
LEFT   mouse button: translating the camera
MIDDLE mouse button: rotating the camera

WHEEL: moving camera backward/forward

SHIFT + WHEEL: advancing the viewing plane (same as SHIFT+UP/DOWN)
SHIFT + RIGHT: rotating the viewing plane around the pivot
SFHIT + LEFT:  translating the pivot
